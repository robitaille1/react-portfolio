      I am a creative, problem solving web developer. I love working in teams
      and contributing to projects that I feel passionate about. Creating
      dynamic, responsive, and interactive web design is what I do best.

      I also love sports (Go Chelsea!), tea, and traveling to experience
      different cultures through food.
